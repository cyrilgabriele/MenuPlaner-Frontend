Create User:
1. Create a new Endpoint to add a user aka person into the DB => work w/ postman only first!!
2. in Callback.vue => create a user with this endpoint now here in frotend in apiService.js
3. redirect the Signup also to pass the Callback.vue so that a user gets added 

After considerations maybe better to make it in the userStore??? maybe only after signup??
